The 'SPIM_MX25' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated 'MAXX3262X EV KIT' Evaluation
Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
    Uses the MX25 SPI Flash Memory on the EvKit to show the SPI Master 
    functionality. Erases, writes, and then verifies the data. BUFF_SIZE, 
    MX25_BAUD, MX25_ADDR, and MX25_SPIM_WIDTH can be changed to alter the 
    communication between the devices. Refer to the schematic for the pinout 
    and ensure that there are no switches blocking the communication to the 
    MX25.
 
 The SPIM_MX26 Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX32620 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the SPIM_MX25 program.
