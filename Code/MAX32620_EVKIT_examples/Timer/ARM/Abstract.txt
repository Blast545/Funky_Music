The 'Timer' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Kit, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   

Configures and starts four different timers.

    PWM Timer        - Outputs a PWM signal (2Hz, 30% duty cycle) on P3.0 LED0
    Continuous Timer - Outputs a continuous 300ms timer on P3.1 LED1 (GPIO toggles every 300ms)
    One Shot Timer   - Starts a one shot time - P3.2 LED2 turns on when one shot time (1 sec) is complete
                       Press P54 SW1 to start the one shot timer again
    Counter Timer -    Counts the number of falling edges on P0.4 up to 5 and then turns on P3.3 LED3
                       On the EV kit, connect P5.5 to P0.4 and use SW2 to change P0.4 input state
    Note: For the counter timer, LED3 may appear to turn on/off sooner than 5 counts because of debounce
          on the switch creating extra edges/counts. 

The Timer Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  Connect P5.5 to P0.4 to increment the Counter Timer using SW2 push button.
