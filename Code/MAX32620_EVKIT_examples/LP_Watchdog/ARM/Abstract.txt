The 'LP_Watchdog' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation Kit, compliant
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

The example program demonstrates using the nanoring watchdog timer (WDT2) to
wake-up from LP1 and/or reset the program.

When the program starts, LED3 is turned on (LP3 mode) and LED0 starts blinking
continuously.

	Open a terminal program to see interrupt messages (115200 baud, 8N1).
    
    SW1: Push SW1 to enter LP1 and wake-up based on watchdog timer's wake-up
    	 period (2 seconds). While in LP1 LED0 stops blinking and LED1 turns on.
    	 After about 2 seconds the watchdog wake-up period expires and wakes up to
   	 	 LP3 (LED3 on, LED0 continuous blinking).
    
    SW2: Push SW2 to enter LP1 and reset program based on watchdog timer's reset
	     period (4 seconds).  While in LP1 LED0 stops blinking and LED1 turns on.
	     After about 4 seconds the watchdog reset period expires and resets the
    	 program. (LED3 blinks three times).
    
    SW3: Push SW3 to trigger a long delay and see the program restart by
	     blinking LED3 three times. During the delay LED0 will stop blinking. This
	     delay is long enough for the reset period to expire and trigger a reset (4
	     seconds).
 
The LP_Watchdog example project is available in a Flash Debug target.

  or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
No jumper configuration is required for the demo program.
