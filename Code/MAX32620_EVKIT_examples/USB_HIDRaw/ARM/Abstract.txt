The 'USB_HIDRaw' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Kit, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Generic USB HID example that can receive/send 64 bytes of data

Example functionality:                                                   
Open a COM terminal window for debug messaging.
    1. Wait for the message "Enumeration complete. Ready to receive or Press SW1 to send 64 bytes..."
    2. Open the Host GUI, USB HID Terminal.
    3. If not already connected to device, enter the Product ID: 0x0480 and Vendor ID: 0x0B6A and click Connect.
    4. Once connected, enter the hex data to send from host to MAX32620 and click Send.
    5. See the data received by MAX32620 in the COM terminal.
    6. On the HID terminal click Wait for Data and then push SW1 on the EVK within 7 seconds to send data from MAX32620 to Host.
    
    Note: Download and install the example Host GUI, USB HID Terminal from www.maximintegrated.com/evkitsoftware 

The Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the Demo program.
