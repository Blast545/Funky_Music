The 'RTC' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated 'MAXX3262X EV KIT' Evaluation
Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Configures and starts the RTC with LED alarms
 - RTC set to 1s ticks with alarms at 3sec and 5sec.
 - LED0: Turns on when alarm 0 value is reached (3secs)
 - LED1: Turns on when alarm 1 value is reached (5secs)
 - LED3: Toggles every 0.5s (LED turns on every 1sec)
 *
Operation:
 - SW1: Push to reset the RTC count to 0 and reset alarm interrupts
 - SW2: Push to set snooze for alarm 1 - alarm 1 = current timer + 10sec
The ADC Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the RTC Demo program.
