The 'Hello_World' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated 'MAXX32620 EV KIT' Evaluation
Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   

 - The message "Hello World!" is displayed on the Evaluation Kit OLED and 
   transmitted via the UART on connector CN1 to a host terminal at 
   115,200 Baud, 8N1.
