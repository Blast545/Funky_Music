The 'USB CDC-ACM' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Kit, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
    Configures the device as an USB-UART adaptor. After loading the project executable, connect a USB cable from CN2 to a host PC. CN1 can also be connected for debug messages. For a Windows PC the driver is the .inf file in the driver folder.
    1. LED0 should turn on once enumeration is complete
    2. Connect another UART device to communicate with to UART1 (TX = P2.1, RX = P2.0).
    3. Open a terminal program for the MAXIM USB-UART adaptor COM port to send/receive data with another UART device.
        
    Notes: The auxiliary UART1 connection is optional. The characters received from the PC will be sent back as an echo.

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the ADC Demo program.
