The 'SPIX_MX25' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated 'MAXX3262X EV KIT' Evaluation
Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
    - Uses the MX25 SPI Flash Memory on the EvKit to show the SPI XiP (Execute in Place)
    functionality of the MAX32620/MAX32621. 
    - Erases, writes, and then verifies the data
    - Executes code from the XiP memory.
    - Refer to the schematic for the pinout and ensure that there are no switches 
      blocking the communication to the MX25.
 
 The SPIX_MX26 Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX32620 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the SPIX_MX25 program.
