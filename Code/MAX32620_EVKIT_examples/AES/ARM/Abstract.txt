The 'AES' example project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation Kit, 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 	
 	- Runs encryption and decryption on different key sizes using NIST Monte-Carlo test vectors.
	- Performs tests using both asynchronous and sychronous operation of the AES peripheral. 
	- Outputs results via serial port as stdout.
 
The AES example is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the AES example program.
