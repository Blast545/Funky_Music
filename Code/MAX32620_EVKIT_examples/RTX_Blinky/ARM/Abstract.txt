The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v4.3.0 to 4.5.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - SYSCLK = 96.00 MHz

 - SysTick is used in interrupt mode as a counter and is based on the 
   96.00 MHz Internal Relaxation Oscillator
 
 - The System Clock is set to the 96 MHz internal relaxation oscillator 
 
 - LED0 will blink at approximately 1 second.
 

The RTX_Blinky program is available in two different targets:

  MAX3262X RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (may be used for target debugging)

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the RTX_Blinky program.
