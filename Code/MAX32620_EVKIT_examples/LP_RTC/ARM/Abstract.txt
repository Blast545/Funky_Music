The 'LP_RTC' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation Kit, 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:     
	- Demonstrates entering low power modes 1 and 0 (LP1 and LP0) from LP3 run 
	  mode.
	- Uses the Real-Time Clock compare feature to wake the part from LP1/LP0

Operation:
	1. On power up, device is in LP3 (LED2 and LED3 on)
	2. Push SW2(P55) push button and the device will go to LP1 sleep mode (only 
	   LED1 on)
	3. After 7 seconds the device will wake up (only LED2 on)
	4. Push SW3(P60) push button and the device will go to LP1 sleep mode (only 
	   LED1 on)
	5. The device will wake up every second and toggle LED1 then returns 
	   to sleep mode
	6. After 7 seconds the device will stay awake (only LED2 on)
	4. Push SW1(P54) push button and the device will go to LP0 sleep mode (only 
	   LED0 on)
	5. After 5 seconds the device will wake up and restarts (three blinks on 
	   LED3 then goes to step 1)

The LP_RTC example program is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No special jumper configuration is required for this example program.
