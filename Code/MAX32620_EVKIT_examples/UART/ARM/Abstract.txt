The 'UART' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Kit, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:

This example loops back the TX to the RX on UART1. For this example you must
connect a jumper across P2.0 to P2.1 and connect P2.2 and P2.3. UART_BAUD and
the BUFF_SIZE can be changed in this example by setting the desired rate and
size using the #defines in main.c.
 
The UART Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  P2.0 to P2.1
  P2.2 to P2.3
