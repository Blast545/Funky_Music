The 'LP_GPIO' example project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation Kit, 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 	- Configures part to enter Low Power Modes 2, 1 and 0
 	- Wakes up from external GPIO push-buttons
 	- Lights LEDs to indicate current status.

Operation:
	1. On power up, device is in LP3 (LED3 on)
 	2. Push SW3(P60) push button and the device will go to LP2 sleep mode (LED2 on)
 	3. Push SW3(P60) again to wake up from LP2 and enter LP3 (LED3 on)
	4. Push SW2(P55) push button and the device will go to LP1 sleep mode (LED1 on)
	5. Push SW2(P55) again to wake up from LP1 and enter LP3 (LED3 on)
	6. Push SW1(P54) push button and the device will go to LP0 sleep mode (LED0 on)
	7. Push SW1(P54) again to wake up and restart program (three blinks on LED3 then stays on)
	
The LP_GPIO example is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the AES example program.
