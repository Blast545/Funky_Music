The 'CLKMAN_4MHz' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation Kit, 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Configures device to use the 4MHz internal oscillator.

 - Reconfigures device to run from the 96MHz internal relaxation oscillator. 

 - Outputs information via stdout over serial. 
  
The CLKMAN_4MHz example program is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No special jumper configuration is required for this example program.
