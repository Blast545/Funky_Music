The 'LP_UART TX' example project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation Kit, 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0). 

Example functionality:                                                    

This example sends data to the LP_UART RX receiver. Connect the TX of
the transmitter (P2.1) to RX (P2.0) of the receiver. Connect CTS of the
transmitter (P2.2) to RTS (P2.3) of the receiver. The debugger has the potential
to reset the receiver as it's transitioning from LP1 to LP3 so it's best to
disconnect the debugger after programming. Once both devices are programmed,
reset the transmitter, reset the receiver, press PB0 on the receiver, and press
PB0 on the transmitter to start the test.

The LP_UART TX example is available in a Flash Debug target.

                   (used for production or target debugging)
