The 'USB_HIDKeyboard' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Kit, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Demonstrates how to configure a the USB device controller as a HID keyboard class device

Example functionality:                                                   

The EvKit should enumerate as a HID Keyboard device.
  1. LED0 will illuminate once enumeration and configuration is complete.
  2. Open a text editor on the PC host and place cursor in edit box.
  3. Pressing pushbutton SW1 will cause a message to be typed on a virtual keyboard one character at a time.
 
The demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the demo program.
