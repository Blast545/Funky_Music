Configures and starts four different pulse trains on GPIO LEDs.

 - P3.0 LED0 - PT8 setup as 1Hz continuous signal that outputs 10110b
 - P3.1 LED1 - PT9 setup as 10Hz continuous square wave
 - P3.2 LED2 - PT10 setup to loop twice and then start PT11
 - P3.3 LED3 - PT11 setup to loop twice and then start PT10
 - P5.4 SW1 - push button setup to stop/start pulse trains

 Note: Interrupts for pulse trains are enabled but the interrupt handler only clears the flags.

The Pulse_Train example is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the demo program.
