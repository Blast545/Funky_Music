The 'USB_HIDKeyboardLP1' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Kit, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

USB HID keyboard demo with lower power mode (LP1) on suspend

Demonstrates how to configure the USB device controller as a HID keyboard class 
device. If USB is suspended LP1 is entered and can wakeup on on VBUS. This demo 
requires a board modification of connecting D+ to a GPIO. See R69 and R70 on the 
schematic.

Example functionality:                                                   
    1. LED0 will illuminate once enumeration and configuration is complete.
    2. Open a text editor on the PC host and place cursor in edit box.
    3. Pressing pushbutton SW1 will cause a message to be typed in on a virtual
       keyboard one character at a time.
    4. To suspend USB put PC host in sleep mode. Observe lower current on VDD12.
    5. Wake up host PC and observe current on VDD12 is higher and the program 
       resumes.
    
The Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the Demo program.
