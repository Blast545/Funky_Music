The 'ADC' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation Kit, 
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - ADC Measurement
 
 - Display output on the LCD
 
 - Measurement results via Serial
 
Options to run via interrupt driven measurements (asynchronously) or via polled mode for measurements.
#undefine USE_INTERRUPTS to operate the demo in polled (synchronous) mode. 

The ADC Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the ADC Demo program.
