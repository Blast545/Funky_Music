The 'Watchdog' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Kit, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Demonstrates a watchdog timer in run mode operation.

Example functionality:   

    1. When the program starts LED3 blinks three times and stops.
    2. Next, LED0 starts blinking continuously.
    3. Open a terminal program to see interrupt messages (115200 baud, 8N1).
 
    SW1: Push SW1 to trigger a watchdog reset. This will reset the watchdog before
         the wait period has expired and trigger an interrupt.
 
    SW2: Push SW2 to trigger a delay and see LED0 stop blinking momentarily.
         This delay is long enough for the timeout period to expire and trigger a watchdog interrupt.

    SW3: Push SW3 to trigger a longer delay and see the program restart by blinking LED3 three times.
         This delay is long enough for the reset period to expire and trigger a watchdog reset.

The Watchdog Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the Watchdog Demo program.
