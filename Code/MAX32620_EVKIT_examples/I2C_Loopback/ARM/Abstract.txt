The 'I2C Loopback' example project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated 'MAXX32620 EV KIT' Evaluation
Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   

 - I2C Master connects to internal I2C slave, performing a loop-back style test.

 - Uses stdout via serial port at 115200 baud to display program status.

The I2C Loopback example program is available in Flash Debug Target

  MAX32620 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Configuration:
  	Connect the following prior to executing the example:
 		- P3.4 to P1.6
        - P3.5 to P1.
        - Jumpers(JP21 and JP22) must be pulled up to the proper I/O
          voltage. Refer to jumper JP27 to determine the I/O voltage.
