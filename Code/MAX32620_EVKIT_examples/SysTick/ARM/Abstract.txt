The 'SysTick' project is a simple program for the MAX32620 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated MAX3262X Evaluation
Kit, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Sets up SysTick timer with options for using the internal 96MHz relaxation oscillator or the external 32.768KHz xtal. 

 - Display output on via stdout over serial port

 - Blinks LED0 every SysTick period (50ms with internal RO, 100ms with external xtal)
 
The SysTick example is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3262X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the SysTick example program.
